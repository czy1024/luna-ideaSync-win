Note that it does not apply to ancestor classes up the class hierarchy; inherited methods need to be locally redeclared in order to participate in a subclass-level annotation. For details on method visibility constraints, consult the &lt;a href=&quot;https:docs.spring.iospring-frameworkdocscurrentreferencehtmldata-access.htmltransaction&quot;&gt;Transaction Management&lt;a&gt; section of the reference manual. &lt;p&gt;This annotation is generally directly comparable to Spring's {@link org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.RuleBasedTransactionAttribute} class, and in fact {@link AnnotationTransactionAttributeSource} will directly convert this annotation's attributes to properties in {@code RuleBasedTransactionAttribute}, so that Spring's transaction support code does not have to know about annotations. &lt;h3&gt;Attribute Semantics&lt;h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;If no custom rollback rules are configured in this annotation, the transaction will roll back on {@link RuntimeException} and {@link Error} but not on checked exceptions. &lt;p&gt;Rollback rules determine if a transaction should be rolled back when a given exception is thrown, and the rules are based on patterns. A pattern can be a fully qualified class name or a substring of a fully qualified class name for an exception type (which must be a subclass of {@code Throwable}), with no wildcard support at present. For example, a value of {@code &quot;javax.servlet.ServletException&quot;} or {@code &quot;ServletException&quot;} will match {@code javax.servlet.ServletException} and its subclasses. &lt;p&gt;Rollback rules may be configured via {@link rollbackFor}{@link noRollbackFor} and {@link rollbackForClassName}{@link noRollbackForClassName}, which allow patterns to be specified as {@link Class} references or {@linkplain String strings}, respectively. When an exception type is specified as a class reference its fully qualified name will be used as the pattern. Consequently, {@code @Transactional(rollbackFor = example.CustomException.class)} is equivalent to {@code @Transactional(rollbackForClassName = &quot;example.CustomException&quot;)}. &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WARNING:&lt;strong&gt; You must carefully consider how specific the pattern is and whether to include package information (which isn't mandatory). For example, {@code &quot;Exception&quot;} will match nearly anything and will probably hide other rules. {@code &quot;java.lang.Exception&quot;} would be correct if {@code &quot;Exception&quot;} were meant to define a rule for all checked exceptions. With more unique exception names such as {@code &quot;BaseBusinessException&quot;} there is likely no need to use the fully qualified class name for the exception pattern. Furthermore, rollback rules may result in unintentional matches for similarly named exceptions and nested classes. This is due to the fact that a thrown exception is considered to be a match for a given rollback rule if the name of thrown exception contains the exception pattern configured for the rollback rule. For example, given a rule configured to match on {@code com.example.CustomException}, that rule would match against an exception named {@code com.example.CustomExceptionV2} (an exception in the same package as {@code CustomException} but with an additional suffix) or an exception named {@code com.example.CustomExceptionAnotherException} (an exception declared as a nested class in {@code CustomException}). &lt;p&gt;For specific information about the semantics of other attributes in this annotation, consult the {@link org.springframework.transaction.TransactionDefinition} and {@link org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAttribute} javadocs. &lt;h3&gt;Transaction Management&lt;h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;This annotation commonly works with thread-bound transactions managed by a {@link org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager}, exposing a transaction to all data access operations within the current execution thread. &lt;b&gt;Note: This does NOT propagate to newly started threads within the method.&lt;b&gt; &lt;p&gt;Alternatively, this annotation may demarcate a reactive transaction managed by a {@link org.springframework.transaction.ReactiveTransactionManager} which uses the Reactor context instead of thread-local variables. As a consequence, all participating data access operations need to execute within the same Reactor context in the same reactive pipeline. @author Colin Sampaleanu @author Juergen Hoeller @author Sam Brannen @author Mark Paluch @since 1.2 @see org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionAttribute @see org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.DefaultTransactionAttribute @see org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.RuleBasedTransactionAttribute @Target({ElementType.TYPE, ElementType.METHOD}) @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Inherited @Documented public @interface Transactional { Alias for {@link transactionManager}. @see transactionManager @AliasFor(&quot;transactionManager&quot;) String value() default &quot;&quot;; A &lt;em&gt;qualifier&lt;em&gt; value for the specified transaction. &lt;p&gt;May be used to determine the target transaction manager, matching the qualifier value (or the bean name) of a specific {@link org.springframework.transaction.TransactionManager TransactionManager} bean definition. @since 4.2 @see value @see org.springframework.transaction.PlatformTransactionManager @see org.springframework.transaction.ReactiveTransactionManager @AliasFor(&quot;value&quot;) String transactionManager() default &quot;&quot;; Defines zero (0) or more transaction labels. &lt;p&gt;Labels may be used to describe a transaction, and they can be evaluated by individual transaction managers.
